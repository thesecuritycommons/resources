##Objective

This policy codifies the zero tolerance approach taken by {{ organistion.shortname }} towards bribery and corruption.

The policy aims to:

- Ensure that financial and other resources are used solely for the intended purposes.
- Promote a culture of honesty and openness among the staff, management and volunteers of {{ organistion.shortname }}.
- Ensure that vulnerable populations are not disadvantaged or exploited by staff members or volunteers or their associates who commit fraudulent and corrupt acts; and
- Assure members of staff, volunteers and partners that they can safely and confidently raise and report all serious concerns about unethical conduct, suspected fraud and corruption.

##Applicability

This policy is applicable to all members, volunteers, contractors, and other contributors, here described as "{{ organistion.shortname }} Associates” when they are directly engaged in an approved activity. This policy does not cover family members of the above individuals or staff under contract with other NGOs or institutions.

The policy also applies to third-party agents and representatives, engaged either formally or informally, to facilitate {{ organistion.shortname }}'s access to goods, services, information and other operational needs.

##Values

{{ organistion.shortname }} is committed to transparency and accountability as fundamental values of the organisation and crucial to ensuring the highest standards. {{ organistion.shortname }} aims to always conduct its operations to the highest ethical standards.

{{ organistion.shortname }} is committed to assisting organisations and programs which alleviate suffering and deliver sustainable and meaningful development.

Corruption eats at the very heart of this by diverting resources away from public services, lowering their quality and often restricting access to essential services such as water, health and education. This profoundly increases the vulnerability of the people we aim to assist through our partnerships and projects.

##Definitions

Corruption is defined as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. It takes many forms and includes bribery, conflict of interest, embezzlement, trading in influence and money laundering.

In spite of being illegal in most countries, corruption can pervade high levels of a government, leading to a broad erosion of confidence in good governance, the rule of law and economic stability.  It also exists in the private sector, and in some countries these boundaries are blurred as business people and politicians are often one and the same.  Corruption distorts the central functioning of the state. It is the manipulation of policies, institutions and rules of procedure in the allocation of resources and financing by political leaders and decision makers who abuse their position to advance their power, status and wealth for personal and political gain, at the expense of the public good.

Bribery is the everyday abuse of entrusted power by low- and mid-level public officials in their interactions with ordinary citizens, who often are trying to access basic goods or services in places like hospitals, schools, police departments and other agencies.  These officials can take decisions or actions on behalf of others by virtue of their authority or position, and are influenced by receiving or by being offered inducements for them to take or refrain from taking an action or decision which they would not have done otherwise, said action or decision being illegal, unethical or a breach of trust.  Inducements can involve the exchange of, or promise of, money or other gifts, loans, fees, inside information, sexual or other favours, rewards, entertainment, employment, or other advantages.

Fraud is an intentional distortion, deceit, trickery, and perversion of truth or breach of confidence, relating to an organization’s financial, material, or human resources, assets, services and/or transactions, generally for the purpose of personal gain or benefit. Fraud is a criminal deception or the use of false representations to gain an unjust advantage.

The definitions above equally apply to all malpractice and unethical behaviour, including, but not restricted to:

- Embezzlement - theft of organisation's resources for own use;
- Misuse and misappropriation of funds;
- Obstruction of justice;
- Sharing of profits / kick backs, cuts, discounts for personal benefits;
- Abuse or misuse of power;
- Extortion - the act of obtaining something by force, threats or undue demands;
- Favouritism - the unfair favouring of one person or a group with something at the expense of others;
- Nepotism - favouritism shown to relatives in conferring offices or privileges;

All forms of corruption and bribery are unethical, detrimental, and unacceptable to {{ organistion.shortname }}.

##Principles of Safety and Security

The safety and security of our staff and volunteers is the highest priority for {{ organisation.shortname }}. As an organisation we accept our Duty of Care for our staff and volunteers when they are deployed on {{ organisation.shortname }} projects. {{ organisation.shortname }} is committed to developing and implementing clear, relevant and proportional security policy, protocols and plans.

We define security as when our people are reasonably protected, and perceive themselves to be protected, and when the organisation’s reputation and integrity is maintained.  We are committed to our responsibility to ensure the physical and emotional well-being of our people before, during and on completion of their period of work with us.

The key to effective safety and security management is the creation of a culture of security and {{ organisation.shortname }} will work to create such an environment. Each staff member and volunteer has a responsibility for their own safety and security, and that of other team members. 

##Applicability

This policy is applicable to all members, volunteers, contractors, and other contributors, here described as {{ organisation.people }} when they are directly engaged in an approved activity. This policy does not cover family members of the above individuals or staff under contract with other NGOs or institutions nor does it cover volunteers who work remotely during {{ organistion.shortname }} activations. 

##Security Strategy

{{ organisation.shortname }} is a {{ organistion.type }} ({{ organistion.shorttype }}) and as such abides by the principles of neutrality and impartiality. These principles are the basis for the active acceptance strategy that {{ organistion.shortname }} employs to mitigate against any risks encountered by our staff and volunteers in the field.

In certain situations, it may also be necessary to adapt protective strategies but these should be inline with international standards and appropriate for the context in which they are employed.

##Implementation

The Security Policy and Protocols are developed by the Executive Director (ED). They will be reviewed on an annual basis and as required by any change in circumstances affecting the organisation.

Review and implementation lies with the ED who is accountable to the Board of Directors. The authority to enforce their implementation and compliance rests with the ED.

##Roles and Responsibilities

Every individual at every level has specific roles and responsibilities. This section outlines at which level certain responsibilities lie and where staff or volunteers should look for guidance or action concerning safety and security issues.

##Code of Conduct

Individual behaviour in the field can have a significant impact on the safety and security of a project. {{ organistion.shortname }} has established a Code of Conduct which all staff and volunteers are required to abide by.

##Protocols

The following protocols apply to all field operations.

###Security Planning

For activities in areas perceived to be high risk, the Project Leader is required to undertake the following prior to deploying staff or volunteers:

- Conduct a thorough Risk Assessment. This includes a written analysis of the context where staff and volunteers will be deployed, including any relevant incidents that may have occurred that could indicate a trend or expose potential vulnerabilities.
- If the risk is sufficiently manageable, a Security Plan must be drafted which details the mitigation measures that will be put in the place to ensure the safety of team members. This plan should also include specific SOPs for the project as well as relevant contact information such as the location of medical facilities and partner organisations.
- The Risk Assessment and Security Plan should be periodically reviewed throughout the project’s lifecycle and amended based on team experiences, incidents or changes to the operational context.

###Briefing
- All staff and volunteers must receive a comprehensive briefing either in person or by email prior to deployment. This briefing should include this security policy as well as the security plan and SOPs in place for the project they will be working on.
- All staff and volunteers are required as a baseline to complete Basic Security In The Field (BSITF) and Advanced Security In The Field (ASITF) from UNDSS and retake this training every two years. In some high risk environments as part of the security plan it may be determined that additional training is required.

###Travel

####Air Travel

UN Charters or airlines that are not listed on the European Union Blacklist are prefered for travel. Permission to travel on other airlines must be approved by the Project Leader. 

####Ground Travel

Next to intentional violence, Road Traffic Accidents (RTAs) are one of the single biggest causes of death and injury for NGO staff.
Travel by well maintained vehicles appropriate for the road conditions with a locally hired driver. Specifics including movement plans and road conditions need to be detailed in the security plan. All journeys must be planned in advance making sure the vehicles are well maintained and have sufficient fuel. In rural areas strictly travel by vehicle only during daylight hours. In rural areas for distances over 300 km should be in a convey of at least two vehicles. To maintain the safety and security of {{ organistion.shortname }} Associates and the impartiality of the organization no weapons of any kind are to be permitted in a vehicle under the immediate control of {{ organistion.shortname }}. 
The security plan will inform of the safety and suitability of local transport. 

####Boat Travel

Travel by well maintained vessel appropriate for the water conditions with a qualified local master. Adequate safety equipment (Personal Flotation Devices (PFD)) and in open waters Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB). 

The security plan will inform of the safety and suitability of local water transport. 

###Accommodation

For stays of longer than three nights {{ organistion.shortname }} Associates should be accommodated in facilities with proper beds with fitted mosquito nets (in tropical contexts), proper showers and toilets. Dependent on security context 24 hour guards and secure lock-up for vehicles may be required.

###Health and safety

{{ organistion.shortname }} projects can often be based in post-disaster areas or developing countries with extreme environments (tropical or desert) and poor amenities (limited potable water or health facilities). While {{ organistion.shortname }} will attempt to ameliorate these conditions as much as possible, all staff and volunteers who participate in these projects should be of sound physical and mental health.

All staff and volunteers are required to have the necessary vaccinations and chemoprophylaxis that may be required for the areas in which they will be working. {{ organistion.shortname }} also undertakes to adequately insure them for emergency medical treatment and evacuation.

All field projects must have a comprehensive first-aid kit and at least one staff member or volunteer who is trained in first-aid.

###Emergency Contact and Medical Information

Prior to being deployed to the field, all staff and volunteers must complete a personal profile which details their next-of-kin contact information, their insurance details, proof-of-life questions and any relevant medical history. This information will be kept as confidential as possible and only used in the event of an emergency. This template for this form can be found in Annex A.

###Communication

Regular check-ins with {{ organistion.shortname }} Headquarters should occur throughout fieldwork. The frequency of check-ins will be determined in the security plan of each individual project based on the risk and circumstances of the particular work.

Field Teams should always have the ability to communicate from the field, typically by mobile phone, but when circumstances require a satellite phone may be required.

Team members must be aware of the location and communication means of their travel companions. If the team goes separate ways for whichever reason, the team leader will ensure that the different parties have means of communication and will determine the interval of the communication.

###Crisis Management

For the purposes of this policy, a Crisis is defined as a situation where there is imminent danger to a staff member, volunteer or the organisation. 

In the event of a Crisis, the Executive Director and Board of Directors will form a Crisis Management Team (CMT) who will take exclusive control of the situation.

###Evacuation

Where the security situation in a given project is deemed to have deteriorated beyond the acceptable limit, the Executive Director (with or without the direction of the board) or the Project Leader can order the evacuation of the field team. This decision cannot be overridden and individual team members cannot choose to stay. Conversely, any individual can opt to leave a project site if they do not feel safe to stay.

The organisation may elect to implement one of the following evacuation strategies:

- Project hibernation. If the degraded security situation is only temporary and restricted to the geographical area of the project, the Project Leader may elect to ‘hibernate’ the project and evacuate all staff and volunteers to a safe place within the country or neighboring country.
- Evacuation. If the situation affects the entire country, the Project Leader may order a full evacuation of staff and volunteers to their country of residence. 

Local staff and volunteers will only be evacuated to a safe place within the country and they may choose to remain in the location if it is normally their home.

###Incident Reporting

Perception of what constitutes a security incident may vary between individuals and contexts. Nonetheless, minor incidents or ‘near misses’ may be indicative of a deterioration in the situation and should be reported, as should any incidents involving partners or other organisations as this may indicate a need to review the risk assessment and security management plan. All security incidents should be reported as soon as possible by the Project Leader to the ED.

Security incidents directly affecting {{ organistion.shortname }} staff and volunteers should be reported using the form at Annex B. In other cases, the reports from the affected organisation should be forwarded, if available, or a brief email summary if not.

###Compensation

For salaried staff {{ organistion.shortname }} in the event of incapacitation resulting in the inability to work. {{ organistion.shortname }} will continue to pay their salary for the duration of their contracted period. For volunteers {{ organistion.shortname }} will pay their stipend for the duration of their contract period. Subject to the organisation’s financial means and insurance arrangements.
